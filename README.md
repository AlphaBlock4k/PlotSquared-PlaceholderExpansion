# PlotSquared PlaceholderAPI Expansion

A lightweight and efficient PlaceholderAPI expansion for PlotSquared that provides real-time plot ownership detection and flag checking. This expansion allows server administrators and plugin developers to check whether a player is currently standing on their own plot and query plot flags, enabling dynamic content, conditional permissions, and enhanced gameplay mechanics.

## üéØ What Does This Expansion Do?

This expansion adds powerful placeholders that return true or false based on plot ownership and flag status. This is particularly useful for:

- **Conditional Menus**: Show different menu items based on plot ownership or flags
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Grant special permissions only when players are on their own plots
- **Custom Scoreboards**: Display plot ownership and flag status in real-time
- **Chat Formatting**: Add special prefixes or badges for plot owners
- **Action Bars & Boss Bars**: Show ownership and flag notifications
- **Conditional Commands**: Execute commands only when players are on their plots or when specific flags are set
- **Economy Systems**: Charge different prices based on plot location and flags
- **Protection Systems**: Add extra security layers based on plot flags
- **PvP Zones**: Create dynamic PvP areas based on plot flags
- **Flight Control**: Manage flight permissions based on plot flags

## üìù Available Placeholders

| Placeholder | Description | Return Value | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `%plotowner_on_own_plot%` | Checks if the player is standing on their own plot as the owner | `true` or `false` | Perfect for conditional logic in any plugin that supports PlaceholderAPI |
| `%plotowner_on_own_plot_<flag>%` | Checks if a specific flag is set on the current plot | `true` or `false` | Check plot flags like PVP, FLY, USE, etc. |

**Important Note**: The ownership placeholder specifically checks for plot ownership. Players who are only trusted or added as members will receive `false`.

### Flag Examples

- `%plotowner_on_own_plot_pvp%` - Returns `true` if the PVP flag is set on the current plot
- `%plotowner_on_own_plot_fly%` - Returns `true` if the FLY flag is set on the current plot
- `%plotowner_on_own_plot_use%` - Returns `true` if the USE flag is set on the current plot
- `%plotowner_on_own_plot_explosion%` - Returns `true` if the EXPLOSION flag is set on the current plot

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact on your server
- **Real-time Detection**: Instant updates when players move between plots
- **PlotSquared Integration**: Uses official PlotSquared API for reliable detection
- **Flag Support**: Check any PlotSquared flag on the current plot
- **Easy to Use**: Simple true/false output works with any plugin
- **No Configuration**: Works out of the box after installation
- **Proper Lifecycle**: Correctly unregisters when removed and reloaded
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles edge cases and errors

## üìã Requirements

- **Minecraft Server**: 1.21.x (Paper or Spigot)
- **Java Version**: Java 21 or higher
- **Required Plugins**:
  - PlaceholderAPI (Latest version)
  - PlotSquared (Version 7.x)

## üîß Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download
Download the latest release JAR file

### Step 2: Install
Place the downloaded JAR file into your server's PlaceholderAPI expansions folder:
```
plugins/PlaceholderAPI/expansions/
```

**Important**: Do NOT place this in the main plugins folder. This is an expansion, not a standalone plugin.

### Step 3: Reload
Run the following command in your server console or in-game:
```
/papi reload
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
Check if the expansion loaded successfully:
```
/papi list
```
You should see `plotowner` in the list of loaded expansions.

### Step 5: Test
Test the placeholders while standing on your plot:
```
/papi parse me %plotowner_on_own_plot%
/papi parse me %plotowner_on_own_plot_pvp%
```
You should see `true` if you're on your own plot, or `false` if you're not.

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Example 1: DeluxeMenus - Conditional Items
Show a special item only when players are on their own plot:

```yaml
plot_settings_item:
  material: COMPARATOR
  slot: 13
  display_name: "&6&lPlot Settings"
  lore:
    - "&7Click to configure your plot"
    - "&7Status: &a%plotowner_on_own_plot%"
  view_requirement:
    requirements:
      must_be_on_plot:
        type: string equals
        input: "%plotowner_on_own_plot%"
        output: "true"
  left_click_commands:
    - "[player] plot flag"
```

### Example 2: FeatherBoard - Dynamic Scoreboard
Display plot ownership and flag status on your scoreboard:

```yaml
board:
  title:
    text:
      - "&6&lMy Server"
  lines:
    line1:
      text: "&7‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"
    line2:
      text: "&ePlot Owner: &f%plotowner_on_own_plot%"
    line3:
      text: "&ePVP Enabled: &f%plotowner_on_own_plot_pvp%"
    line4:
      text: "&eFlight: &f%plotowner_on_own_plot_fly%"
    line5:
      text: "&eLocation: &f%player_world%"
    line6:
      text: "&7‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"
```

### Example 3: ConditionalEvents - Flag-Based Events
Execute commands based on plot flags:

```yaml
pvp_zone_enter:
  type: player_move
  conditions:
    - "%plotowner_on_own_plot_pvp% == true"
  actions:
    default:
      - "message: &c&lYou entered a PVP zone!"
      - "sound: ENTITY_ENDER_DRAGON_GROWL"
```

## üîç How It Works

The expansion uses the official PlotSquared API to:
1. Convert the Bukkit player to a PlotSquared player object
2. Get the plot at the player's current location
3. Check if the plot exists
4. For ownership: Verify if the player's UUID matches the plot owner's UUID
5. For flags: Check if the specified flag is set on the plot
6. Return `true` or `false` accordingly

This process is highly optimized and causes minimal performance impact, even with hundreds of players online.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does it show "false" when I'm trusted on a plot?**  
A: This expansion specifically checks for plot ownership. Only the plot owner will receive `true`. Trusted members and added players will receive `false`.

**Q: Does this work with merged plots?**  
A: Yes! If you own a merged plot and stand anywhere on it, the placeholder will return `true`.

**Q: Can I use this for road detection?**  
A: Yes! If the placeholder returns `false` and the player is in a plot world, they're either on a road or on someone else's plot.

**Q: What's the performance impact?**  
A: Minimal. The expansion uses efficient PlotSquared API calls and includes error handling to prevent lag.

**Q: Why is the identifier "plotowner" and not "plotsquared"?**  
A: PlaceholderAPI already has a built-in expansion with the identifier "plotsquared". To avoid conflicts, this expansion uses "plotowner".

**Q: What happens if I delete the expansion and reload?**  
A: The expansion will be properly unregistered and removed from memory. This was fixed in version 1.0.1.

**Q: Can I check any PlotSquared flag?**  
A: Yes! You can check any flag that PlotSquared supports. Just use `%plotowner_on_own_plot_<flagname>%` with the flag's name.

**Q: What if a flag doesn't exist or isn't set?**  
A: The placeholder will return `false` if the flag doesn't exist or isn't set on the plot.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Expansion not loading
- Ensure PlotSquared is installed and running
- Check that the JAR is in `plugins/PlaceholderAPI/expansions/`
- Run `/papi reload`
- Check console for error messages

### Placeholder shows nothing
- Verify the expansion is loaded: `/papi list`
- Test the placeholder: `/papi parse me %plotowner_on_own_plot%`
- Ensure you're using the correct identifier: `plotowner` not `plotsquared`

### Always shows "false"
- Confirm you are the plot owner (not just trusted)
- Check with `/plot info` to verify ownership
- Ensure you're standing within plot boundaries
- For flags: Verify the flag is actually set with `/plot flag list`

### Expansion still registered after deletion
- Make sure you're using version 1.0.1 or higher
- Delete the JAR file from `plugins/PlaceholderAPI/expansions/`
- Run `/papi reload`
- Verify with `/papi list` that it's no longer listed
